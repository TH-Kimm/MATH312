# Probability (II)

## Continuous Random Variable (RV)

A continuous random variable can take any value within its range. For example, it might yield a value between 10 and 120 (such as the daily high temperature in the U.S.) or any value from 0 to infinity (such as the failure time of a particular device in minutes).

## Probability Distribution of Continuous RV

A continuous probability distribution can be represented as a curve $f(x)$ that spans the possible values of a random variable. Its shape can vary depending on the variable of interest, but it has the following properties:
1. The total area under the probability density curve is 1.
2. $P[ a\le X\le b ]$ is the area under the probability density curve between $a$ and $b$.
3. $f(x)\ge 0$  for all $x$.

## The Normal Distribution

In our class, we focus on the normal distribution because:
1. All manner of things appear to be distributed normally: peopleâ€™s height, IQ scores, examination grades, sizes of snowflakes, errors in measurements, lifetimes of lightbulbs, and so on;
2. Central Limit Theorem;
3. Easy to deal with.

A normal distribution can be characterized by two parameters: the mean $\mu$ and the variance $\sigma^2$ (or equivalently, the standard deviation $\sigma$).

# Probability calculation

Probability calculations under a normal distribution can be easily performed using the function $\texttt{pnorm(c)}$. Similar to using a $z$-table, this function provides the left-tail probability based on a cutoff value of $c$.

Suppose $X$ to be the # of beer cans consumed by a female college student in a year. It is assumed to be normally distributed with the mean 360 and standard deviation 80. What proportion of female students drink less than 400 beer cans per year? 

```{webr-r}
# Given information
x <- 400
mu <- 360
sigma <- 80
# z-score
z <- (x-mu)/sigma

# Probability calculation
pnorm(z)

# Graphical Illustration
x <- -1000:1000/300
y <- dnorm(x)
shadeDist(z,"dnorm",0,1,col=c("black","brown"),main="Area under Standard Normal Curve",xmin=-3.5,xmax=3.5)
```

This approach precisely emulates how we typically perform probability calculations using the $z$-table. Now, we can simplify the process by using the second and third arguments of the $\texttt{pnorm()}$ function, which allow us to specify the mean and standard deviation of the distribution directly.

```{webr-r}
# Given information
x <- 400
mu <- 360
sigma <- 80
# Probability calculation
pnorm(x,mu,sigma)

# Graphical Illustration
x <- 360+(-1000:1000)/30
y <- dnorm(x)
shadeDist(400,"dnorm",360,80,col=c("black","brown"),main="Area under Standard Normal Curve")

```

## Example

Let $Y$ be the # of beer cans consumed by a male college student in a year. It is assumed to be normally distributed with the mean 640 and standard deviation 60. What proportion of male students drink more than 595 beer cans per year? 
```{webr-r}
y <-
mu <-
sigma <-
```

## Sampling Distribution for Sample Mean

The sampling distribution provides all the information about a statistic of interest. When examining the behavior of a sample mean randomly drawn from a population, we first consider the following properties:

* The mean of "the sampling distribution for the sample mean" will always equal the population mean $\mu$:
$$\mu_\bar{X}=E[\bar{X}]=\mu.$$
* The standard deviation of "the sampling distribution for the sample mean" will equal the population standard deviation $\sigma$ over the square root of the sample size $n$:
$$\sigma_\bar{X}=SD[\bar{X}]=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.$$

Then, the shape of the sampling distribution can be described as follows:

1. If population distribution is a normal distribution, then the sampling distribution for sample mean would resemble the shape of the population distribution. So, the sampling distribution also follows a normal distribution with the above mean and standard deviation.

2. If population distribution is unknown, then the sampling distribution for sample mean would still follow a normal distribution with the above mean and standard deviation when we have sufficiently large sample size, e.g., $n\ge 30$.

In particular, we call the second result **the central limit theorem (C.L.T)**.

# Probability calculation

Suppose a test score has the mean value 78 and standard deviation 10. We don't have any information regarding the population distribution. Suppose we are interested in the probability that a sample mean with the sample size $n=32$ is greater than 82.
```{webr-r}
# Given information
mu <- 78
sigma <- 10
n<-35
x <- 82

# the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution
mu_xbar <- mu
sigma_xbar <- 10/sqrt(35)

#Probability calculation based on the C.L.T.
1 - pnorm(x,mu_xbar,sigma_xbar)
```




# Verification of C.L.T. through a simulation 

Lastly, let us verify the central limit theorem through a short simulation. Here, we assume the population distribution is highly skewed to the right. 

```{webr-r}
## C.L.T. Simulation for exponential population distributions
set.seed(2024)
m<-500
x<-1:10000/500

plot(x,dexp(x,1/9),lwd=3,type="l",main="Population distribution: Highly Skewed Version")
abline(v=9,col="blue",lwd=3)
legend("topright",legend=c("true mean"),lwd=2,col=c("blue"))

sam_dist_mean_exp<-function(N=30)
{
sample_means<-NULL
for(i in 1:m)
  sample_means[i]<-mean(rexp(N,1/9))
hist(sample_means,probability=TRUE,lwd=2,col="brown",main=paste("Sampling Dist'n of sample mean: n=",N),xlim=c(0,20))

abline(v=9,col="blue",lwd=2)
curve(dnorm(x,9,9/sqrt(N)),add=TRUE,lwd=2)
}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
sam_dist_mean_exp(2)
sam_dist_mean_exp(5)
sam_dist_mean_exp(15)
sam_dist_mean_exp(30)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
Note that the shape of the histogram (the empirical sample mean distribution) converges toward the theoretical sampling distribution (represented by the black curve) as the sample size increases from $n=2$ to $n=30$.
