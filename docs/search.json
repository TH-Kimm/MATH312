    "text": "What is R?\nR is a versatile computer program that enables a wide range of statistical calculations and data analysis. Developed and maintained largely through voluntary contributions from statisticians globally, R is a free and open-source tool available on most operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.\nBeyond statistical analysis, R also excels in creating graphics and functions as a full-fledged programming language. In this series of labs, we will only begin to explore the extensive capabilities that R offers."

    "text": "How can we run R?\nThe base R environment is always accessible, but most users prefer to work with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for a more user-friendly interface. RStudio, for example, is one of the most popular IDEs today.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you can download and run R locally on your system, it’s not necessary for our labs, as they can be completed directly within self-contained webpages. We recommend sticking to the content provided on the lab webpages to familiarize yourself with the syntax. Once you feel comfortable with the language, you can easily run R on your laptop."

Below is a list of ACE concentrations (measured in ng/L) from 15 different pools in the US: \\[ 438,  211,  640,   85,   83,  350,  138,   49,  465,  489,55, 1086,   71, 1058,  247.\\]\n\n\n\nIn R, create a vector of these data and give it an appropriate name.

BA:    Batting Average, \"the # of times a batter hits a ball and reaches the base\"/\"the # of at bats by a batter\".   \n05. OPS:   On-base plus slugging, the sum of on-base percentage and slugging percentage. \n06. ORPG:  Opponent Runs per Game, the runs per game by the opponent.   \n07. ERA:   Earned Run Average, the number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings.    \n08. WHIP:  Walks And Hits Per Inning Pitched, the statistic shows how well a pitcher has kept runners off the basepaths, one of his main goals.\n\nIn the data set, the variable \\(\\texttt{Win\\_P}\\) measures a MLB team’s performance throughout the 2023 season. For offensive capability, we can use the variables \\(\\texttt{RPG}\\), \\(\\texttt{BA}\\), and \\(\\texttt{OPS}\\); whereas, for defensive capability, we can use \\(\\texttt{ORPG}\\), \\(\\texttt{ERA}\\), and \\(\\texttt{WHIP}\\).",

    "text": "A “random variable” can be viewed as a numerical variable with known possible values, though the actual value remains unknown until the corresponding experiment is completed. Since numerical variables can be either discrete or continuous, random variables can also be classified as discrete or continuous.\n\n\n\nA discrete random variable can take on countably distinct values. For example, it might yield an integer between 1 and 6 (as in the outcome of rolling a die) or an integer from 1 to infinity (such as the number of car accidents in the U.S. in a given year).\n\n\nA box model is a useful way to model an experiment with a discrete random variable. Suppose we have a box containing three balls marked with 1, five balls marked with 2, and two balls marked with 3. We draw a ball with replacement, meaning:\n\nExtract a ball.\nCheck the number on it.\nPut the ball back into the box.\nRepeat the process.\n\nDue to this “replacement” condition, the theoretical probability of drawing a 1, 2, or 3 remains constant throughout the experiment. If we define the random variable \\(X\\) as the number marked on the drawn ball, the corresponding discrete probability distribution is:\n\n\n\nx\n1\n2\n3\nTotal\n\n\n\n\np(x)\n3/10\n5/10\n2/10\n10/10=1\n\n\n\nThe shape of the distribution can be illustrated:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow, we can use the \\(\\texttt{sample()}\\) function in \\(\\textbf{R}\\) to implement the experiment using the box model. This means we assume the model and simulate the process of drawing balls from the box.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that each time you run the code, the set of drawn balls will differ due to the randomness of the experiment. Now, we can summarize the sample data using a frequency table for the observed numbers as follows:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the frequency table closely aligns with the theoretical probability distribution. This illustrates the concept of long-run probability—the idea that the relative frequency of an event (e.g., \\(X=1\\), \\(X=2\\), or \\(X=3\\)) converges toward the theoretical probability with repeated trials. We can further verify this by examining the trajectories of relative frequencies:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nAs learned, the mean and variance of a discrete probability distribution can be calculated by: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\mu =& \\sum x p(x)\\\\\n  \\sigma^2 = & \\sum (x-\\mu)^2p(x),\n\\end{align*}\\] where the summation is taken over all possible values of \\(X\\). Using R, we can easily compute these quantities. For example, with our box model:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can also calculate these values empirically using the data we generated.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nThe binomial probability distribution is one of the most widely used discrete distributions. Consider an experiment with two possible outcomes: success or failure, each with a fixed probability of success \\(p\\). If this experiment is repeated \\(n\\) times, the total number of successes can be modeled as a binomial random variable \\(X\\), which can take any integer value from 0 (no success) to \\(n\\) (all successes).\nRecall that the probability of observing exactly \\(x\\) successes is given by: \\[\np(x)=\\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}.\n\\]\n\n\nStephen Curry is renowned for his three-point shooting, but he also holds the highest career free-throw percentage in NBA history (91%).

    "text": "A discrete random variable can take on countably distinct values. For example, it might yield an integer between 1 and 6 (as in the outcome of rolling a die) or an integer from 1 to infinity (such as the number of car accidents in the U.S. in a given year).\n\n\nA box model is a useful way to model an experiment with a discrete random variable. Suppose we have a box containing three balls marked with 1, five balls marked with 2, and two balls marked with 3. We draw a ball with replacement, meaning:\n\nExtract a ball.\nCheck the number on it.\nPut the ball back into the box.\nRepeat the process.\n\nDue to this “replacement” condition, the theoretical probability of drawing a 1, 2, or 3 remains constant throughout the experiment. If we define the random variable \\(X\\) as the number marked on the drawn ball, the corresponding discrete probability distribution is:\n\n\n\nx\n1\n2\n3\nTotal\n\n\n\n\np(x)\n3/10\n5/10\n2/10\n10/10=1\n\n\n\nThe shape of the distribution can be illustrated:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow, we can use the \\(\\texttt{sample()}\\) function in \\(\\textbf{R}\\) to implement the experiment using the box model. This means we assume the model and simulate the process of drawing balls from the box.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that each time you run the code, the set of drawn balls will differ due to the randomness of the experiment. Now, we can summarize the sample data using a frequency table for the observed numbers as follows:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the frequency table closely aligns with the theoretical probability distribution. This illustrates the concept of long-run probability—the idea that the relative frequency of an event (e.g., \\(X=1\\), \\(X=2\\), or \\(X=3\\)) converges toward the theoretical probability with repeated trials. We can further verify this by examining the trajectories of relative frequencies:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nAs learned, the mean and variance of a discrete probability distribution can be calculated by: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\mu =& \\sum x p(x)\\\\\n  \\sigma^2 = & \\sum (x-\\mu)^2p(x),\n\\end{align*}\\] where the summation is taken over all possible values of \\(X\\). Using R, we can easily compute these quantities.
